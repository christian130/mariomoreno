<h3 style="width:100%;color:#ff6633;margin-top: 10px;float: left;">Whatsdadilly Privacy Policy</h3>

<p class="textt">
<b>Website Visitors</b><br>

Like most website operators, Whatsdadilly Inc. (Whatsdadilly) collects non-personally-

identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, 

such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each 

visitor request. Whatsdadilly’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying 

information is to better understand how Whatsdadilly’s visitors use its website. From time 

to time, Whatsdadilly may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, 

e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.<br><br>

Whatsdadilly also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet 

Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users posting on Whatsdadilly.com or 

related properties and only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same 

circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information.
</p>

<p class="textt">
<b>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</b><br>
Certain visitors to Whatsdadilly’s Website choose to interact with Whatsdadilly in ways 

that require Whatsdadilly to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and 

type of information that Whatsdadilly gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For 

example, we ask visitors who sign to contribute Postings at Whatsdadilly.com to provide a 

username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with or through 

Whatsdadilly are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the 

personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, 

Whatsdadilly collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill 

the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Whatsdadilly. Whatsdadilly does not disclose 

personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always 

refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent 

them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<p class="textt">
<b>Aggregated Statistics</b><br>
Whatsdadilly may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For 

instance, Whatsdadilly may monitor the most popular Postings on the Whatsdadilly.com 

site or use spam filter services to identify spam posted in place of proper Postings. 

Whatsdadilly may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, 

Whatsdadilly does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described 

below.
</p>

<p class="textt">
<b>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</b><br>
Whatsdadilly discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying 

information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) 

need to know that information in order to process it on Whatsdadilly’s behalf or to provide 

services available at Whatsdadilly’s website(s), and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it 

to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located 

outside of your home country; by using Whatsdadilly’s websites, you consent to the 

transfer of such information to them. Whatsdadilly will not rent or sell potentially 

personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its 

employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Whatsdadilly 

discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in 

response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Whatsdadilly 

believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or 

rights of Whatsdadilly, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a 

Whatsdadilly website and have supplied your email address, Whatsdadilly may send you 

notifications of content of interest as specified in your Whatsdadilly account options, 

occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just 

keep you up to date with what’s going on with Whatsdadilly and our products. We 

primarily use our various internally produced featured product related Postings to 

communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep email to a minimum. If you 

send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), 

we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to 

help us support other users. Whatsdadilly takes all measures reasonably necessary to 

protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially 

personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<p class="textt">
<b>Cookies</b><br>

uses cookies to help Whatsdadilly identify and track visitors, their usage of Whatsdadilly 

website, and their website access preferences. Whatsdadilly visitors who do not wish to 

have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before 

using Whatsdadilly’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Whatsdadilly’s 

websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<p class="textt">
<b>Business Transfers</b><br>
If Whatsdadilly, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that 

Whatsdadilly goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of 

the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such 

transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Whatsdadilly may continue to use your 

personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

<p class="textt">
<b>Ads</b><br>
Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, 

who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each 

time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others 

who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, 

deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This 

Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Whatsdadilly and does not cover the use of 

cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<p class="textt" style="margin-bottom:50px;">
