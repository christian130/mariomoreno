    oh i forgot in the last commit it's having me the wrong people from the sentence directly from sql... it's something weird... in model/comments.php in the line sixty (60) i'm launching a raw SQL but it's not giving me the errors... possible error bad joins... have to do the left and the right and inner properly, but i'm quite tired today

    now it write it down with purely ORM... when you push the enter button it'll go to the DB and stores it... now the thing i've got to do is 'sanitize' the post... THE ENTER BUTTON WORKS into the machine and it's supported...
